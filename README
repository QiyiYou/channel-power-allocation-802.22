- The codes are for the implementation of the following paper:
  Di Li and James Gross, Distributed TV Spectrum Allocation for Cognitive Cellular Network under Game Theoretical Framework Proc. of the IEEE Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN'12) 2012

- All schemes are run from ChannelAssignment.m
  Configuration of the network, output and tuning of schemes are noted in the comment in the file.

- The proposed scheme, along with the comparison schemes, are run with the same network.
